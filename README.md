# Toyota Mechanical Innovation Challenge â€“ Vehicle Design

Welcome to my project repository for the **Toyota Mechanical Innovation Challenge**. This challenge, hosted by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada (TMMC), involved designing and presenting an automated guided vehicle (AGV) capable of safely transporting car doors and boxes within a simulated factory setting.

## ðŸ“Œ Challenge Overview
We are tasked with developing a mechanical system that can:
- ðŸ›» **Pick up and move car doors** from a 5-inch-tall shelf to a designated location.
- ðŸ“¦ **Pick up and move boxes** from a 10-inch-tall shelf to the ground.
- ðŸ”„ Efficiently switch between "door-moving" and "box-moving" modes.
- ðŸš— Navigate forward, backward, and around corners.
- ðŸ’¸ Optimize for speed, cost, safety, and ease of use.

## ðŸ§± System Requirements
- Must not damage parts during transport.
- Must be able to operate safely in a warehouse environment.
- Mechanisms must mount to a Tetrix base using 8 screws (maximum).
