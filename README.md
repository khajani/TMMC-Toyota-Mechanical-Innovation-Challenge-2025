# 🚗 Toyota Mechanical Innovation Challenge – AGV Design

Welcome to my project repository for the **Toyota Mechanical Innovation Challenge**. This challenge, hosted by Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada (TMMC), involved designing and presenting an automated guided vehicle (AGV) capable of safely transporting car doors and boxes within a simulated factory setting.

## 📌 Challenge Overview
We are tasked with developing a mechanical system that can:
- 🛻 **Pick up and move car doors** from a 5-inch-tall shelf to a designated location.
- 📦 **Pick up and move boxes** from a 10-inch-tall shelf to the ground.
- 🔄 Efficiently switch between "door-moving" and "box-moving" modes.
- 🚗 Navigate forward, backward, and around corners.
- 💸 Optimize for speed, cost, safety, and ease of use.

## 🧱 System Requirements & Constraints
- Must not damage parts during transport/handling.
- Must be able to operate safely in a warehouse environment.
- Mechanisms must mount to a Tetrix base using 8 screws (maximum).
- Must be built with the given materials and a maximum of two 3D printed parts (=< 27 cm^3)

## 🧰 Materials Used
- 1 **Tetrix Prizm Microcontroller**
- 1 **Tetrix Max kit** (Hardware kit)
- 1 **TeleOp Module**
- 2 **Custom 3D Printed Components** (Gripper)
- 1 **Ultrasonic Sensor** (Human & Obstacle Detector) 
- 1 **DC Motor with Encoder** (Arm Lifting Mechanism) 
- 2 Servos (Arm Lifting Mechanism)
- 1 Battery (12V)
- 1 PS4 Controller
- 1 Pre-Made Four Wheel Tetrix Base

## ⚙️ How it Works 
### Moving to Shelf
Controlled by the PS4 controller, the AGV moves towards the shelf. 
### Picking up Products
